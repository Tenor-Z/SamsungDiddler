# SamsungDiddler
Python program I made to fuck with my family's Samsung TV during family events
The SendKeys functions were not made by me, special thanks to Julien Leticher!

Sends a connection to the TV IP address specified and sends button requests encoded in
Base64.

# How to use
Add your TV's IP, your IP and your MAC address in the respective fields. Change the sendkey queries to whatever you desire.

This was adapted from a much older program.
